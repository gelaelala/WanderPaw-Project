**Project Name:** WanderPaw

**Project Description:**
 - WanderPaw is an application that mainly focuses on the adoption of pets. This would help shelters with difficulty finding pet lovers to adopt their pets, struggling pet owners willing to place their pets up for adoption, and individuals who would love to have a new pet by adopting one. This app aims to promote the saying "Adopt, Don't Shop" as this will be an instrument for stray/abused pets to find their new home and avoid them to the risks that may bring when they were left on the streets.
